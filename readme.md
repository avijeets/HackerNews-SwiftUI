# HackerNews-SwiftUI

Trying out the new SwiftUI library, introduced with Xcode 11, to build out the UI of a straightforward master-detail application. This project pulls Hacker News articles through the [Algolia API](http://hn.algolia.com/api/) and displays them in a UITableView with their respective scores. Clicking into any cell will bring up a WKWebView displaying the URL of the post.
